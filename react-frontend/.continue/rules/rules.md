# React Coding Conventions

## General

*   Use functional components with hooks.
*   Follow the Airbnb JavaScript Style Guide (with adjustments for TypeScript).
*   Use descriptive variable and function names.

## Components

*   Component files should be named using PascalCase (e.g., `MyComponent.tsx`).
*   Components should be placed in the `src/components` directory, or in subdirectories based on feature or module.
*   Use prop types for all components.

## Hooks

*   Custom hooks should be placed in the `src/hooks` directory.
*   Custom hook names should start with `use` (e.g., `useMyHook`).

## Styling

*   Use Tailwind CSS classes for styling components.
*   Avoid inline styles.
